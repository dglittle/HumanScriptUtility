- if you have time to do this task right now, reply-all to this message saying "got it" (only the first person to say "got it" should do it)

- when you log time, use the subject line of this task as the message

// part 1

- create a github repository called "HumanScriptUtility"

- put these instructions (along with the attached image), and the subject line of this message, in a new file in the "humanscript" directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist)

// part 2

- create index.html
- put "hello world" inside it

- create main.js
- make it a simple node.js server that uses express
    - use port 8090
    - make loading localhost:8090 load index.html
- test it to make sure you can see "hello world"

- make index.html look like the attached image,
    - where A is a list of clickable divs
    - B is a textarea
    - C is a textarea
    - D is a button that says "preview >"
    - E is a button that says "submit"
- add these behaviors
    - when text is typed in B,
        make the first div in A always show the first line of the text in B
    - when the user clicks the second div in A,
        clear the text in B
    - when text is typed in B now,
        make the second div in A always show the first line of the text in B
    - when the user clicks the first div in A again,
        make B show the text that was in B before they clicked the second div
    - make this functionality work for all the divs,
        where each div is like a "file",
        and when you click it,
        you see the text in that file,
        and you can edit it
    - when "preview >" is clicked,
        - replace any occurance of <<<(.*?)>>> with the contents of the "file" (from A) named in match-group 1
        - keep doing this replacement until there are no more cases of <<<(.*?)>>>
        - put the output in C
    - when "submit" is clicked,
        make an ajax call to "/submit",
        and make a handler in main.js to handle that, returning "ok!",
        and show the response in an alert dialog

- test it
    - type "first" into B, press enter, type "Hello there <<<second>>>"
    - click the second div in A
    - type "second" into B, press enter, type "world!"
    - press "preview >"
    - press "submit"
    - move the alert so it's out of the way of other stuff
    - take a screenshot
    - put it in "humanscript/output"

// last part

- commit and push to github
- respond to this thread saying "done: " + give link to repository so I can fork it
